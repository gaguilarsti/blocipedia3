Blocipedia: A Ruby on Rails application that allows users to create public and private Markdown-based wikis, similar to Wikipedia.

This project was created as part of the Bloc.io Full Stack Web Development Program.

An online production version of this project can be found here: https://damp-reaches-60904.herokuapp.com/ 

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).
